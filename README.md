# LFSR_NLFSR
Designed, implemented, and analyzed four shift register (LFSR, three NLFSR models) in Java to evaluate their performance in generating pseudo-random sequences. Analysis mathematically to prove polynomial  p ( x ) = x 7 + x 4 + x 2 + 1 p(x)=x  7  +x  4  +x  2  +1 reducible and non-primitive, explaining its failure to achieve a max-length per.
